# mazahua app

This is my first freelance flutter project, it's a quiz app where you can log in and play one of the different quiz games this app it's for teaching kids different colors, animals, fruits, and more in an indigenous language called "Mazahua".

There were four kinds of questions in the game and they can include sounds, images, etc... The dynamics of the game are these: choose the better option, choose the better option when you click the correct sound, and choose the correct answers by clicking the image.

Some features have bugs because the client didn't want to pay me, so I've never completed the app.


Technologies used for the project:

- Flutter framework
- SQLite for the database
- Bloc pattern for state management



PD: This is not a commercial app...
